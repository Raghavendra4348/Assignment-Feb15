Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
To be honest I wanna say this to you
Go away, hey now, do not go away
Hey, show me how you feel, oh no,
don't show it to me
All day today
I can't get you out off my mind
Would you like it if I meet up
